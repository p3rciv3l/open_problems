# Local Life agar certificate experiments

The strongest certificate here exhaustively checks all 4096 `4 x 3`
B3/S23 input blocks and proves an average live-cell density bound of
`12001/20000 = 0.60005` for every finite, spatially periodic Life orbit.
It does **not** prove the conjectured `1/2` bound.

## Two-center spacetime-strip inequality

The larger block contains a `4 x 3` slice at time `t` and the two Life
outputs above its middle horizontal pair at time `t+1`. Its left and
right faces each contain a translated `3 x 3` input block plus one output
bit, so they are genuine two-time-slice faces. The top and bottom faces
are `4 x 2` input strips, and the temporal faces are the current and next
two-bit center pairs.

For every block `a`, the rational tables in `strip2_certificate.json`
satisfy

```
c1(a) + c2(a) <= 12001/10000
                   + X[L(a)] - X[R(a)]
                   + Y[T(a)] - Y[D(a)]
                   + Z[C(a)] - Z[N(a)].
```

Summing over a finite space-time torus cancels every potential against a
translated copy. Each cell occurs twice on the left, giving density at
most `12001/20000`. The exact verifier checks all 4096 inequalities.

This tested ansatz has 1024 arbitrary values on each horizontal
spacetime-face type, 256 on each vertical face type, and four on each
temporal-pair type. A four-pattern nonnegative balanced witness proves
that no bound below `3/5` is possible in this ansatz. The checked upper
certificate is `12001/20000`, obtained by rounding the numerical LP
potential to a `1/10000` grid and then recomputing the required constant
exactly. Thus the **verified** LP-optimum interval is
`[3/5, 12001/20000]`; no claim of exact attainment at `3/5` is made.

## Radius-one baseline

For a `3 x 3` neighborhood `a`, let `c(a)` be its center and let `n(a)` be
the next state of that center under B3/S23. The two-column left and right
faces are `L(a), R(a)`, and the two-row top and bottom faces are
`T(a), D(a)`. The stored rational tables satisfy, for every one of the 512
neighborhoods,

```
c(a) <= 8/13
        + X[L(a)] - X[R(a)]
        + Y[T(a)] - Y[D(a)]
        + Z[c(a)] - Z[n(a)].
```

Sum this inequality over all cells and all times of a finite space-time
torus. Each spatial face term cancels its translated neighbor, and each
time term cancels at the next time. Thus the average density is at most
`8/13`. This applies to oscillating agars represented by any finite
spatial fundamental domain and any finite temporal period.

The baseline ansatz is intentionally small: spatial radius 1, time depth 1, an
arbitrary rational potential on each six-bit spatial face, and an
arbitrary rational potential on the one-bit temporal face. `8/13` is the
exact optimum **of this LP ansatz**. The nonnegative 57-pattern
`optimality_witness` in `certificate.json` has balanced face marginals,
total mass 1, and center occupancy `8/13`, so it gives the matching LP
lower bound. It is only a locally consistent fractional distribution; no
claim is made that it extends to a Life orbit.

## Reproduce and verify

The verifier uses only the Python standard library and exact
`fractions.Fraction` arithmetic:

```sh
cd life_agar_certificate
python verify.py
python strip2_verify.py
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

To rerun the floating-point LP, rationalize its output, and check the
result exactly:

```sh
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python solve.py
python strip2_solve.py
python verify.py
python strip2_verify.py
```

Both solve scripts enumerate their neighborhoods, apply B3/S23 directly,
and use SciPy/HiGHS. They refuse to emit a certificate unless the
rationalized local inequalities and rational lower witnesses pass the
same exact checks as the dependency-free verifiers.
