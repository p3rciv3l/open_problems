# Radius-one Life agar certificate experiment

This experiment exhaustively checks all 512 radius-one B3/S23 input
neighborhoods and proves an average live-cell density bound of `8/13` for
every finite, spatially periodic Life orbit. It does **not** prove the
conjectured `1/2` bound.

## Local inequality

For a `3 x 3` neighborhood `a`, let `c(a)` be its center and let `n(a)` be
the next state of that center under B3/S23. The two-column left and right
faces are `L(a), R(a)`, and the two-row top and bottom faces are
`T(a), D(a)`. The stored rational tables satisfy, for every one of the 512
neighborhoods,

```
c(a) <= 8/13
        + X[L(a)] - X[R(a)]
        + Y[T(a)] - Y[D(a)]
        + Z[c(a)] - Z[n(a)].
```

Sum this inequality over all cells and all times of a finite space-time
torus. Each spatial face term cancels its translated neighbor, and each
time term cancels at the next time. Thus the average density is at most
`8/13`. This applies to oscillating agars represented by any finite
spatial fundamental domain and any finite temporal period.

The ansatz is intentionally small: spatial radius 1, time depth 1, an
arbitrary rational potential on each six-bit spatial face, and an
arbitrary rational potential on the one-bit temporal face. `8/13` is the
exact optimum **of this LP ansatz**. The nonnegative 57-pattern
`optimality_witness` in `certificate.json` has balanced face marginals,
total mass 1, and center occupancy `8/13`, so it gives the matching LP
lower bound. It is only a locally consistent fractional distribution; no
claim is made that it extends to a Life orbit.

## Reproduce and verify

The verifier uses only the Python standard library and exact
`fractions.Fraction` arithmetic:

```sh
cd life_agar_certificate
python verify.py
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

To rerun the floating-point LP, rationalize its output, and check the
result exactly:

```sh
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python solve.py
python verify.py
```

`solve.py` enumerates all neighborhoods, applies B3/S23 directly, and
uses SciPy/HiGHS. It refuses to emit a certificate unless the rationalized
local inequalities and the rational optimality witness both pass the same
exact checks as `verify.py`.
